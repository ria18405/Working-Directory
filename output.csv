We have a new version of GrimoireLab: elasticgirl.18.1. In fact, it
just upgrades the version numbers over elasticgirl.18, which is the
real release, and was released this morning. Details:

We have a new release of GrimoireLab [1]. The corresponding packages
have been uploaded to pypi (so they're installable with pip). I've
tested most of the examples in the Training Tutorial [2] with this new
release, and everything seems to work.

Just a minor update done during last days:

* I've tested Hatstall against a couple of SortingHat databases, like a
dump of OPNFV project community data (~ 3K identities). If your database
has less than that number of identities, it should work ok. For databases
bigger than
that, you might experience some lags, because at some points, Hatstall
retrieves all the identities items. Perhaps future changes in SortingHat",Chaoss,Chaoss,2017-11-17T09:36:47+01:00,1,0.70.0,ScmsPipermailEnrich,2020-05-22T06:47:47.503460+00:00

provide a feature to re-distribute a post that has been sent *before*

about this.
