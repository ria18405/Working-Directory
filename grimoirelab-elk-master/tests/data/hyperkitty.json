For now,\nwe're still using them, and basing some services on them. But with\ntime, the new tools should provide all their functionality, and likely\nBitergia will no longer actively maintain them. Which doesn't mean that\nsome of their developers (be them hired by Bitergia or not) still\nmaintain them in their own time.\n\nSaludos,\n\n\tJesus.\n\n> Andy\n> \n> 2016-04-14 11:06 GMT+02:00 Jesus M.
