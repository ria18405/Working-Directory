            "html": "I\u2019m not one to live in the past (well, except maybe for A-Team re-runs), but for many&nbsp;years now, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve had unfinished business. I started the service ONElist in 1998. ONElist made it easy for people to create, manage, run and find email groups. As it grew over the next two and a half years, we expanded, changed our name to eGroups, and, in the summer of 2000, were acquired by Yahoo. The service was renamed Yahoo Groups, and I left the company to pursue other startups.<br><br>But really this story starts even further back, in the Winter of 1989, when in college I was introduced to mailing lists. I was instantly hooked. It was obvious that a mailing list was a great way to communicate with a group of people about a common interest. I started subscribing to lists dedicated to my favorite bands (\u201980\u2019s Hair Metal, anyone?). I joined a list for a local running club. And, at every company I\u2019ve worked at since graduating, there have been invaluable internal company mailing lists.<br><br>But that doesn\u2019t mean that mailing lists&nbsp;can\u2019t&nbsp;improve. And this is where we get back to the unfinished business. Because email groups (the modern version of mailing lists) have stagnated over the past decade. Yahoo Groups and Google Groups both exude the dank air of benign neglect. Google Groups hasn\u2019t been updated in years, and some of Yahoo\u2019s recent changes have actually made Yahoo Groups worse! And yet, millions of people put up with this uncertainty and neglect, because email groups are still one of the best ways to communicate with groups of people. And I&nbsp;have a plan to make them even better.<br><span><br>So today I\u2019m launching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\">Groups.io</a>&nbsp;in beta, to bring email groups into the 21st Century. At launch, we have many features that those other services don\u2019t have, including:</span><ul><li>Integration with other services, including: Github, Google Hangouts, Dropbox, Instagram, Facebook Pages, and the ability to import Feeds into your groups.</li><li>Businesses and organizations can have their own private groups on their own subdomain.</li><li>Better archive organization, using hashtags.</li><li>Many more email delivery options.</li><li>The ability to mute threads or hashtags.</li><li>Fully searchable archives, including searching within attachments.</li></ul>One other feature that Groups.io has that Yahoo and Google don\u2019t, is a business model that\u2019s not based on showing ads to you. Public groups are completely free on Groups.io. Private groups and organizations are very reasonably priced.<br><br>We\u2019re just starting out; following&nbsp;the tradition of new startups everywhere, we\u2019re in Beta. So, as we squash the inevitable bugs and work to make the system even better&nbsp;(based on your feedback!), all features will be free.<br><span><br>I\u2019m passionate about email groups. They are one of the very best things about the Internet and, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\">Groups.io</a>, I\u2019ve set out to make them even better. As John \u2018Hannibal\u2019 Smith, leader of the A-Team, liked to say, \u201cI love it when a plan comes together.\u201d</span>\n\n\n"

Here are some highlights:</p>\r\n<h5>Photos</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Every group now has a photos section. Photos are stored in albums. An album can be set to allow any group member to upload photos, or it can be set to restrict uploads just to the person who created it. In addition, the Photos section can be set to allow uploads by group members, or it can be restricted just to moderators and owners.</p>\r\n<h5>Max Attachment Size</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't want to receive large attachments in your group messages? You can specify the max attachment size allowed in messages you receive. If an attachment is larger than your max size, you'll get a link to it on the Groups.io website instead. See your Subscription page for all the goodness.</p>\r\n<h5>Default Subscription Options</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Owners, you can now specify default subscription options for new people joining your group. Do your members generally like to be on digest? Set that as a default, and new people joining will default to that (of course, they can change their subscription whenever they want). The new Default Sub Settings page can be accessed from the Settings page of your group.</p>\r\n<h5>Calendar Improvements</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We've made several small improvements to the calendar. You can now specify that a notification is sent to your group when an event happens. You can also specify hashtags in event names. And we're now tagging messages sent from the calendar: reminders have the tag #cal-reminder, notifications have the tag #cal-notice and calendar invites are tagged with #cal-invite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that's not a passel of new features, then I don't know what a passel is (and I just looked up that word before writing this). Of course, we're not done. Have an idea for how to improve Groups.io?

In addition, the Photos section can be set to allow uploads by group members, or it can be restricted just to moderators and owners.\r\n\r\n##### Max Attachment Size\r\nDon't want to receive large attachments in your group messages? You can specify the max attachment size allowed in messages you receive. If an attachment is larger than your max size, you'll get a link to it on the Groups.io website instead. See your Subscription page for all the goodness.\r\n\r\n##### Default Subscription Options\r\nOwners, you can now specify default subscription options for new people joining your group. Do your members generally like to be on digest? Set that as a default, and new people joining will default to that (of course, they can change their subscription whenever they want). The new Default Sub Settings page can be accessed from the Settings page of your group.\r\n\r\n##### Calendar Improvements\r\nWe've made several small improvements to the calendar. You can now specify that a notification is sent to your group when an event happens. You can also specify hashtags in event names. And we're now tagging messages sent from the calendar: reminders have the tag #cal-reminder, notifications have the tag #cal-notice and calendar invites are tagged with #cal-invite.\r\n\r\nIf that's not a passel of new features, then I don't know what a passel is (and I just looked up that word before writing this). Of course, we're not done. Have an idea for how to improve Groups.io? Join the [beta group](https://groups.io/org/groupsio/beta/join) and let us know.\r\n\r\nThanks for using Groups.io!\r\n\r\nMark\r\n\r\n"

Now, you can receive notifications whenever there are changes to your Trello boards, cards and lists. Configure this integration through the Integrations page for your group.</p>\r\n<h5>Google Drive Integration</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We also added Google Drive integration. Like our <a href=\"http://dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a> integration, you can configure Groups.io to automatically save specific attachments sent to your groups in your Google Drive. Configure this integration through the Subscription page for a group.</p>\r\n<h5>RSS Archive Feeds</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Public archives now have RSS feeds. Enter the URL of a group home page into your favorite feed reader, and you will receive group messages directly in your reader.</p>\r\n<h5>Moderated Hashtags</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Hashtags can now be moderated. Whenever a thread is tagged with a moderated hashtag, all messages in the thread will require approval before being sent to the group. Configure moderated hashtags through the Hashtags page in your group.</p>\r\n<h5>Likes</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, you can now like messages. Click the 'Like' button under a message on the Groups.io website, or, you can reply to a message with a simple 'like' or '+1' (without the quotes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, we're not done.

It's a new year and we wanted to update you on some of the improvements we've made to Groups.io over the past several months. If we listed all the improvements, this message would be way too long. Instead, here's a sampling of what\r\nwe've done:</p>\r\n<h5>New Mobile Site</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven't visited the website on your phone or tablet lately, you should check it out. We've made it much easier to work with your\r\ngroups while on the go. There's new navigation specifically for small screens and infinite scroll to make viewing messages easier.</p>\r\n<h5>Chat</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can now create chat rooms to go along with your groups. Some conversations are best done in threads and posts, some conversations are best in chat. We now support both!</p>\r\n<h5>Better Profiles</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can now change your profile for each of the groups you're a member of. Use a different photo, change your display name, set a different bio.</p>\r\n<h5>Enterprise Version of Groups.io</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We've been hard at work on the Enterprise version of Groups.io. With this option, you can specify your own domain name and logo, and other options. Look for an announcement about it soon.</p>\r\n<h5>Other changes, in brief:</h5>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Two Factor Security.

            "plain": "Greetings from Groups.io,\r\n\r\nThe updates group has been quiet, but we've been working hard on improving Groups.io. It's a new year and we wanted to update you on some of the improvements we've made to Groups.io over the past several months. If we listed all the improvements, this message would be way too long. Instead, here's a sampling of what\r\nwe've done:\r\n\r\n##### New Mobile Site\r\n\r\nIf you haven't visited the website on your phone or tablet lately, you should check it out. We've made it much easier to work with your\r\ngroups while on the go. There's new navigation specifically for small screens and infinite scroll to make viewing messages easier.\r\n\r\n##### Chat\r\n\r\nYou can now create chat rooms to go along with your groups. Some conversations are best done in threads and posts, some conversations are best in chat. We now support both!\r\n\r\n##### Better Profiles\r\n\r\nYou can now change your profile for each of the groups you're a member of. Use a different photo, change your display name, set a different bio.\r\n\r\n##### Enterprise Version of Groups.io\r\n\r\nWe've been hard at work on the Enterprise version of Groups.io. With this option, you can specify your own domain name and logo, and other options. Look for an announcement about it soon.\r\n\r\n##### Other changes, in brief:\r\n\r\n- Two Factor Security. You can now set up two-factor security on your account, for extra protection.\r\n- RSVPs for Events. People can RSVP to events, and you can view and message those who have responded.\r\n- New Member Directory. Each group can have a member directory, where you can view the profiles of other members of your group.\r\n- Custom Signatures. You can specify custom signatures to be added to your messages.\r\n- Groups can be set to auto-moderate or auto-close threads after a specified number of days.\r\n- Database tables have a new Image column.\r\n- You can upload and include images in your Wiki pages now.\r\n\r\nHave an idea for how to improve Groups.io? Join the [beta](https://groups.io/org/groupsio/beta/join) group and let us know!\r\n\r\nRemember, you can unsubscribe from these notices at any time. Just click on the 'Unsubscribe' link in the footer of this message.\r\n\r\nThanks for using Groups.io and have a great weekend!\r\n\r\nMark\r\n"

            "html": "I\u2019m not one to live in the past (well, except maybe for A-Team re-runs), but for many&nbsp;years now, I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ve had unfinished business. I started the service ONElist in 1998. ONElist made it easy for people to create, manage, run and find email groups. As it grew over the next two and a half years, we expanded, changed our name to eGroups, and, in the summer of 2000, were acquired by Yahoo. The service was renamed Yahoo Groups, and I left the company to pursue other startups.<br><br>But really this story starts even further back, in the Winter of 1989, when in college I was introduced to mailing lists. I was instantly hooked. It was obvious that a mailing list was a great way to communicate with a group of people about a common interest. I started subscribing to lists dedicated to my favorite bands (\u201980\u2019s Hair Metal, anyone?). I joined a list for a local running club. And, at every company I\u2019ve worked at since graduating, there have been invaluable internal company mailing lists.<br><br>But that doesn\u2019t mean that mailing lists&nbsp;can\u2019t&nbsp;improve. And this is where we get back to the unfinished business. Because email groups (the modern version of mailing lists) have stagnated over the past decade. Yahoo Groups and Google Groups both exude the dank air of benign neglect. Google Groups hasn\u2019t been updated in years, and some of Yahoo\u2019s recent changes have actually made Yahoo Groups worse! And yet, millions of people put up with this uncertainty and neglect, because email groups are still one of the best ways to communicate with groups of people. And I&nbsp;have a plan to make them even better.<br><span><br>So today I\u2019m launching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\">Groups.io</a>&nbsp;in beta, to bring email groups into the 21st Century. At launch, we have many features that those other services don\u2019t have, including:</span><ul><li>Integration with other services, including: Github, Google Hangouts, Dropbox, Instagram, Facebook Pages, and the ability to import Feeds into your groups.</li><li>Businesses and organizations can have their own private groups on their own subdomain.</li><li>Better archive organization, using hashtags.</li><li>Many more email delivery options.</li><li>The ability to mute threads or hashtags.</li><li>Fully searchable archives, including searching within attachments.</li></ul>One other feature that Groups.io has that Yahoo and Google don\u2019t, is a business model that\u2019s not based on showing ads to you. Public groups are completely free on Groups.io. Private groups and organizations are very reasonably priced.<br><br>We\u2019re just starting out; following&nbsp;the tradition of new startups everywhere, we\u2019re in Beta. So, as we squash the inevitable bugs and work to make the system even better&nbsp;(based on your feedback!), all features will be free.<br><span><br>I\u2019m passionate about email groups. They are one of the very best things about the Internet and, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groups.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\">Groups.io</a>, I\u2019ve set out to make them even better. As John \u2018Hannibal\u2019 Smith, leader of the A-Team, liked to say, \u201cI love it when a plan comes together.\u201d</span>\n\n\n"

Like our <a href=\"http://dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a> integration, you can configure Groups.io to automatically save specific attachments sent to your groups in your Google Drive. Configure this integration through the Subscription page for a group.</p>\r\n<h5>RSS Archive Feeds</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Public archives now have RSS feeds. Enter the URL of a group home page into your favorite feed reader, and you will receive group messages directly in your reader.</p>\r\n<h5>Moderated Hashtags</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Hashtags can now be moderated. Whenever a thread is tagged with a moderated hashtag, all messages in the thread will require approval before being sent to the group. Configure moderated hashtags through the Hashtags page in your group.</p>\r\n<h5>Likes</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, you can now like messages. Click the 'Like' button under a message on the Groups.io website, or, you can reply to a message with a simple 'like' or '+1' (without the quotes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, we're not done.

Configure this integration through the Subscription page for a group.\r\n\r\n##### RSS Archive Feeds\r\n\r\nPublic archives now have RSS feeds. Enter the URL of a group home page into your favorite feed reader, and you will receive group messages directly in your reader.\r\n\r\n##### Moderated Hashtags\r\n\r\nHashtags can now be moderated. Whenever a thread is tagged with a moderated hashtag, all messages in the thread will require approval before being sent to the group. Configure moderated hashtags through the Hashtags page in your group.\r\n\r\n##### Likes\r\n\r\nAnd finally, you can now like messages. Click the 'Like' button under a message on the Groups.io website, or, you can reply to a message with a simple 'like' or '+1' (without the quotes).\r\n\r\nOf course, we're not done. Have an idea for how to improve Groups.io? Join the [beta](https://groups.io/org/groupsio/beta/join) group and let us know.\r\n\r\nThanks for using Groups.io!\r\n\r\nMark\r\n"

            "plain": "Changes to the site this week:\r\n\r\n- BUGFIX: In the mobile view, the Subgroups link was not always displayed when it should be.\r\n- BUGFIX: Fixed several screen reader accessibility issues throughout the site.\r\n- CHANGE: Updated the Google Group transfer page with changed directions.\r\n- BUGFIX: Fixed the Edit button on the Hashtags page on Safari.\r\n- BUGIFX: The 'Upload File' button was never disabled, even when it should have been, due to a typo in the HTML.\r\n- CHANGE: Removed lavabit.com from the list of banned email domains, because they no longer have a disposable email address feature.\r\n- CHANGE: For messages with both a plain text and html part, we now insert the message footer into both parts (previously we'd only insert it into the html part).\r\n- CHANGE: Ignore bad certificates from Yahoo when downloading y! group photos.\r\n- CHANGE: Tweaked plan text message footers to make them much smaller.\r\n- CHANGE: When inviting someone who is not already a Groups.io user, prioritize setting their Full Name to what was in the invite over what their email is set to.\r\n- CHANGE: Changed the time format in the calendar views to use am and pm instead of a and p.\r\n- NEW: You can now change the owner of a photo album.\r\n- NEW: You can now change the owner of an individual photo.\r\n- BUGFIX: Removed unused Search button on the chat page.\r\n- CHANGE: When viewing poll results, keep the order of respondents the same in View By Answer mode. Also removed pagination widget, because we don't currently paginate that page.\r\n- BUGFIX: For messages with text larger than 32kb in length, we incorrectly passed a much shorter part of the message to the search indexer than was necessary.\r\n- CHANGE: Changed the gavel icon to a scale to represent moderated threads.\r\n- BUGFIX: Some error messages weren't being displayed correctly when editing a group's settings (such as group description being too short).\r\n- NEW: Exportgroup now exports more member data, in json format. For premium/enterprise groups, we now export past member data. And we export member notices.\r\n- NEW: You can now move photos between photo albums.\r\n- CHANGE: In the pending message page, all buttons are disabled until at least one message is selected.\r\n- INTERNAL: Completed switchover to new search cluster.\r\n- CHANGE: In message, wiki and api revision list pages, if there are two revisions checked, and we check another revision, we remove the oldest revision check.\r\n\r\nHave a good weekend everybody.\r\n\r\nMark\r\n"
